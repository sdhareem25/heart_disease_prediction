# heart_disease_prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. The process includes data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate results.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Features include: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.

## Methods
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates.
-	Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot distributions, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.
-	Train-Test Split: Shuffled and split dataset into training and testing sets for fair evaluation.
-	Model Used: Logistic Regression.
-	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.

## Results
- Accuracy: 86%
- Precision: 96%
- Recall: 78%

## How to run
-	Open heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
-	Run all cells to see data cleaning, visualisations, and predictions.Run
